# The Status Quo

This folder contains documents that diagnose and critique the problems inherent in our current ways of working and organizing society. These papers articulate the "enemy" that Nearmydear is designed to combat: the crushing weight of institutional and digital bureaucracy.

## Files

- **[absurdity_of_current_society.md](./absurdity_of_current_society.md)**: Presented as a stand-up comedy routine, "The Civilization of Layers" satirizes modern bureaucracy as a self-perpetuating pyramid scheme that creates endless complexity for its own sake.

- **[meeting_culture.md](./meeting_culture.md)**: An analysis of the deep-rooted causes of today's time-wasting meeting culture. It traces the problem to legacy command-and-control management, psychological biases, and a fundamental lack of process discipline.

# Long-Term Vision

This folder contains documents that explore the long-term, "North Star" vision for the technology and principles behind Nearmydear. These papers extrapolate the core concepts to the scale of urban governance, painting a picture of a future where technology serves human community.

## Files

- **[vision_for_city_os.md](./vision_for_city_os.md)**: A technical framework describing the "AI City OS." It details how AI-driven coordination, built on open standards, can handle urban complexity, allowing for decentralized, community-led governance and human-centric design.

- **[vision_for_european_cities.md](./vision_for_european_cities.md)**: A manifesto, written in the style of a speech, that calls for a new "European Renaissance." It argues for using AI to break free from industrial-era, car-centric city planning and return to walkable, vibrant, and democratically-governed communities.

- **[vision_for_human_first_urbanism.md](./vision_for_human_first_urbanism.md)**: A more focused, speech-oriented document that critiques the current urban hierarchy where traffic flow is prioritized over human life. It calls for a simple but radical inversion: putting people, neighborhoods, and "life flow" first.

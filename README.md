# Nearmydear Documentation

**Human Intent, AI Execution.**

Nearmydear is a human-first collaboration platform designed to combat digital bureaucracy and restore deep, meaningful interaction to the workplace. It uses an AI-native approach where personal AI agents handle the mechanical work of coordination, freeing humans to focus on creativity, connection, and critical decision-making.

Our vision is to build a new operating principle for work, moving away from systems that force humans to act like machines and toward a future where technology serves human purpose.
